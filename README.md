# JavaScript Practice - Game Development

For this project, I wanted to learn the basics, or rather the main ideas of creating a platformer video game on the web using only JavaScript. I originally wanted to learn enough so that I would be able to create my own game, but after following tutorials and reading lots documentation and code, it is going to take a lot more time and practice to create my own game. So I mainly decided to learn as much as I can so that I can have a better understanding of what goes on and what is required.

The software that I wrote mainly came from following a few tutorials on JavaScript Game Development. While there are a few things that I did on my own, the main idea for this project was to learn and practice.
This JavaScript game is a vary basic platformer game. Basically, there is a map with platforms on it and you move a character to jump around them. This game contains player movement, player animation for each movement and action, player collision, and many more fun game elements. While there is really no story or purpose other than jumping around platforms, it is still pretty enjoyable to move around a image that has been coded to move, jump, and fall. 

Again, the main purpose of this software was to learn how it works and what it takes to build games using JavaScript. This included learning more about how building a program using classes works, using inheritance to make them work together in specific ways, and learning more about how useful object oriented programming really is. While I can't take full credit for the code, I wrote all of it out myself and took the time to understand how it all functions and works together to become what it is.

# Development Environment

* Visual Studio Code
* JavaScript for all of the code
    * Canvas API Element to build the game
* HTML / CSS

    - This video (4 hour video tutorial) was the main inspiration and learning that I did for this project. It was a huge help in learning how it all works and where to really start with building games using JavaScript.
    - The sprite images were provided through this tutorial.

    - This was also gave a good deal of inspiration, but I decided to go with the video that is above.


# Future Work

- Build an actual game based on what I have built already. This could be adding on different game elements and objectives to build into the game. Collecting items or coins or something.
- Adding on the idea above, build more maps or areas and learn how to add enemies and other characters into the game to make it more interactive.
- Take what I've learned and work on my own project to further practice JavaScript game development.
- I have a lot of ideas of games that I want to build, so taking what I have learned during this project and then take one of those game ideas and make it a reality.
